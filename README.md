# Advent of Code (2021)

Welcome to the Advent of Code[^aoc] Kotlin project created by [ischwarz23][github] using the [Advent of Code Kotlin Template][template] delivered by JetBrains.

In this repository, I'm about to provide solutions for the puzzles using [Kotlin][kotlin] language.

[^aoc]:
    [Advent of Code][aoc] â€“ an annual event in December since 2015.
    Every year since then, with the first day of December, a programming puzzles contest is published every day for twenty-four days.
    A set of Christmas-oriented challenges provide any input you have to use to answer using the language of your choice.
